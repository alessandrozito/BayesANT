# Introduction 

[`BayesANT`](https://github.com/alessandrozito/BayesANT) is an R package that runs the Bayesian nonparametric taxonomic classifier desscribed in @Zito2022_BayesANT The code is available at this [github repository](https://github.com/alessandrozito/BayesANT).

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# If the devtools R package is not already installed
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("alessandrozito/BayesANT")
library(BayesANT)
```


## Package description
```{r}
file.train <- system.file("data/trainDNA.fasta", package = "BayesANT")
file.test <- system.file("data/testDNA.fasta", package = "BayesANT")
```




![Example of a Pitman--Yor process with $n= 19$, $\alpha = 1$, $\sigma = 0.25$ and $K_n=4$. Taxa names are reported on top of the circles, and frequency of appearance are written on the right to the blue DNA sequences, respectively. Fractions in black denote the taxon probabilities for the orange DNA sequence. For example, the probability of observing the butterfly-shaped taxon $V_1^*$ is $(n_1 - \sigma)/(\alpha+n) = (10 - 0.25)/(19 + 1) = 39/80$. The probability for the unknown question mark taxon is $(\alpha + \sigma k)/(\alpha+n) = (1 + 4\times0.25)/(19 + 1) = 1/10$.](Pitman_Yor_UrnScheme.png){#id .class width=70% height=70%}
